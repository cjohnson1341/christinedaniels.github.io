		<p>What would it look like if I created a game based on my job? This was the thought I had late one night after the 4th time explaining to someone at a party what a UI/UX designer was. I ended up making a joke that went along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm basically just a pixel pusher,‚Äù which got me an awkward laugh in return, but gave me a great idea for a game.

			The idea of the game is that you, the designer, must navigate the corporate world to ultimately become the triumphant voice for your users. You will have to dodge many perils along the way, such as scope creep, limited funding, and the dreaded ‚Äúswoop-and-poop‚Äù. Your coworkers become valuable assets in the journey to the end product, and you have to carefully balance earning XP from interviewing users and doing research versus your energy meter, which can become depleted if not refueled by sleep or coffee. It would be a fun, silly, and lighthearted game.

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p>While I had a rough idea of the core game ‚Äúfeel‚Äù, I wasn‚Äôt sure what type of game I wanted to make yet. Would it be on PC or on Switch? Would it have a more character driven game mechanic like the Sims or more survival mode like The Last of Us? Or maybe a puzzle game like Unraveled 2? To answer those questions, I started looking up games that I personally found very engaging and ended up with a few key characteristics that I wanted to include:
			<ul class="list">
			<li>‚Ä¢ A minimal UI: I discovered that I really enjoy games that had very minimal UI, with the game centered more on the character and the stories in the game, rather than the mechanics. Games that I thought did this really well were Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and Genshin Impact.</li>
			<li>‚Ä¢ A customizable character screen: In every game I‚Äôve ever played, I spend at least 30 minutes to an hour (if not more *cough* Sims *cough) customizing my characters. I looked at a range of games for this concept, from World of Warcraft, with pretty minimal character customization, all the way up to the intricate fine-tuned detail screens in The Sims 4. </li>
			<li>‚Ä¢ Low-poly style: This was something I was most excited about. While I really enjoy the beautifully stylized characters in games like Assassin‚Äôs Creed, Skyrim, and WoW, I have recently been really drawn to the art of low-poly games like Animal Crossing, Going Medieval, and Minecraft. They feel so much more delightful and silly at times, which I think would go well with the theme of lightheaded fun for my game.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		<p>Onto the wireframes! During this stage, I really wanted to iterate as much as I could before investing in very time-heavy UI creation. The main point of the wireframing stage for me was to make sure the information flowed nicely from screen to screen for the user; I also wanted to make sure that I explored ways to let the user back out of options if they went somewhere they didn‚Äôt intend to go.</p>
		<p>Before I even touched a computer, though, I wanted to get the rough ideas out of my head and onto paper. Even after doing this for a while, it‚Äôs amazing to me how a design can look so different in your head vs. when you put it down on paper; the human brain has an amazing way of hiding the flaws in your designs from you ü§£. </p>
		<p>Originally, I was thinking this game would be more of a timed runner game, kind of like Temple Run, where you would have to dodge PMs and VPs to get your design delivered on time. But there were a few flaws with that idea, the major one being that I wanted the player to feel like they could collaborate with other designers and navigate the corporate world rather than feeling like a football player running a pass down the field. So that idea was scratched.</p>
		<p>I then sketched out some ideas for a more open-world type game, where the world was an office building with a couple floors that could be navigated by the user. This felt more in line with the original game theme, so I settled on creating wireframes for that idea.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="images/Game_Sketches.jpg">
		</figure>	
		<p>While wireframing, I ended up going back and doing more research on the open world games that I thought had minimal user interfaces. I also tried to keep my scope limited to just the initial user start up, since I was on a tight time schedule. I felt that focusing on this area would help me later down the road since many of the screens and UI components from an initial user onboarding can be reused in other screens.</p>

		<h2>3D Modeling</h2>
		<p>Because I had never tried my hand at 3D modeling before, I was really excited to give it a go. I decided that I would spend the bulk of my time learning how to do basic character modeling and lighting/rendering, since those would build a good knowledge base for me in the future if I went back to visit this game idea. For the office itself, I knew that it would take more time than I had to create all the assets I would need, so I found and downloaded a wonderful office model from lowpolyside on CGTrader.</p>

		<h2>UI High Fidelity</h2>
		<p>After settling on the final wireframes and picking two screens to do high fidelity renders on, I imported them into Photoshop and got to work. I started with the much more complicated play screen first, since it would help me work on a broader range of UI components that could be reused on the character creation screen. </p>
		<p>Because my game was low-poly, I looked up examples of low-poly user interfaces and tried to mimic the style as best I could. I had a few moments where I had to start over because my UI was looking too flat, but in the end I‚Äôm happy with the designs. I also added a bit of ‚Äúweathering‚Äù to my UI components, and that seemed to make them stand out a bit more from the screen.</p>

		<h2>After Thoughts</h2>
		<p>While this was a great exercise in game design, there are definitely a few improvements I would like to make. </p>
		<p>On the character creation screen, I realized that my 3D character currently only accommodates people with large chest areas and doesn‚Äôt allow for customization in that area. Instead of adding the typical ‚Äúmale‚Äù ‚Äúfemale‚Äù option, I think I would like to somehow make a slider to adjust the chest size to make a more inclusive option for players who maybe identify as female but don‚Äôt necessarily want to be represented that way by a large chest; I also want people who identify as neither to not have to choose a gender. However, a slidable chest area might make the lives of my developers a bit more complicated, so we would have to talk that one through üòÖ.</p>
		<p>Another area that I would have liked to explore is accessory options. This could be a unique way to identify the player if the game ever expanded into a co-op situation. Since low-poly games don‚Äôt often come with a large number of distinguishing characteristics, accessories like a blue hat or a green dragon scale backpack could be fun ways to individualize a character.</p>
		<p>On the play screen itself, I think the XP bar could use a few more iterations. While I explored a lot of options in the wireframing stage for the quest log, map, player item areas, I didn‚Äôt do much exploration of the XP bar. A few questions I have about it as it stands: Does the XP counter within the bar give the user any additional information that the bar itself could not provide? Do we need it? Also, is the player‚Äôs level in an area that is visible enough that they don‚Äôt have to go searching for it? And lastly, though it matches the style of the rest of the UI elements, does it detract from the rest of the play experience by being so large at the top of the screen? Or would players rather see a smaller XP bar somewhere else, like in other open world games (ie: WoW and Genshin Impact).</p>
		<p>Lastly, I‚Äôm not sure if the ‚Äúweathering‚Äù that I added to my UI elements really fits with the low-poly corporate theme of the game. While it might be more applicable for a world builder game or maybe a map conquest game, the weathered look of craggy buttons and boxes might distract the player by looking out of place.</p>
		<p>All in all, this was a heckin‚Äô lot of fun, and what started as a small exercise might actually turn into a really fun side project for me this year.</p>
